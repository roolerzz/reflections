This file would contain the changes encountered in the reflection 3.

1) Create a remote repository using the github profile. This should not contain the readme as we will be pushing our repository onto it.
2) Our local repository would interact with the remote using git push and git pull commands. Changes that are not already present in the remote will be pushed.
3) Before pushing the changes onto the remote, first configure a remote inside your local repository. 
git remote - will give you the remotes configured to your repository. 
git remote add origin URL 
git remote -v - will give verbose output. (FETCH and PUSH remotes saying from where you will fetch the data and where you would push the data).

4) git push origin master(BRANCH_NAME_TO_SYNC) 

QUES : When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
ANS : when remotely you would want to collaborate with people staying anywhere in the world just having an internet connection.
