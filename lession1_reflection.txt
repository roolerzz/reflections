my lession 1 reflections,

Git - a cool version control system. 
It will allows multiple people to work on same projects simultaneously and then integrate all the changes together. 
In lession 1, we learnt,
git diff commitID1 commitID2 - Compare the differences between 2 commit IDs.
git clone - clone a git repository to your local.
git log - shows all the previous git commits in the local repository.
Set up git workspace where in we added some colors to the shell which helped us differentiate the current user, the branch or commit I am working on, and are there any loacal changes that are yet to be committed into the repository.
The we learnt Git Checkout, which is very different from svn checkout. git checkout takes us to a particular commit ID state (and shows the message head detached, which means that the current head is not the master of current branch).
